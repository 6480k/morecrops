# 6480's More Crops

Welcome to the page for 6480's More Crops (and future related mods). This is a modular expansion intended to bring balanced, vanilla-style expansions to crops, fruit trees, artisan goods, and much more! Balance suggestions, ideas, and translations are very much welcome.

More Crops is set up to be fully customizable in your use of different "packs", which means you can choose to add different themed groups of items depending on your personal play style. Whether you want to have 10, 50, or even zero new crops; or if you want to have a massive orchard, a blooming flower field, or an industrial fish cannery; you can pick what you like while keeping perfection completely achievable. You can even turn off all custom content and only use this mod for the changes it makes to vanilla items, for example.

Roadmap:
- Core pack (A selection of essential crops and fruit trees to mesh with the vanilla selection.)
- Artisan goods (Expands upon artisan goods to provide more mid- and late-game options for production lines.)

Potential packs (no guarantees):
- Thai cooking (Some Asian crops accompanied by recipes from Thai cuisine.)
- Baker's Valley (An artisan goods pack focused on baking and fancy coffees)
- Florist (Adds an assortment of flower crops to the game.)
